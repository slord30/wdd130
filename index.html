            <p>Hi there! My name is Sarah Lord. I live in The Woodlands, Texas, but I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am the mother of 4 awesome kids, ages 19, 17, 15, 12. I love to learn, bake, eat chocolate - especially brownies, and design graphics and websites. It is so nice to meet you!</p>
